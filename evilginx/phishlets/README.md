## üìö Additional Resources

### Community Phishlet Collections

- **An0nUD4Y Collection**: [Evilginx2-Phishlets](https://github.com/An0nUD4Y/Evilginx2-Phishlets/tree/master)
- **ArchonLabs Collection**: [evilginx2-phishlets](https://github.com/ArchonLabs/evilginx2-phishlets/tree/master)

Both collections are comprehensive resources, though slightly dated as they were developed for Evilginx2 ~v2.3. They feature excellent documentation for common defense bypass techniques.

*Note: I am not affiliated with these additional resources - they are simply excellent community collections worth referencing.*
