# Hacking Scripts 🛠️

A collection of automation scripts and tools for penetration testing, red team operations, and security research.

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains various automation scripts that I use in my professional security work. These tools are designed to streamline common tasks, automate tool setup, and improve efficiency during security assessments.

## 🚀 Current Scripts

### EvilGinx Setup Automation
- **Location**: `evilginx-setup/`
- **Description**: Automated download, installation, and configuration of EvilGinx phishing toolkit
- **Documentation**: See `evilginx-setup/README.md` for detailed usage instructions

## 🎯 Planned Scripts

- [ ] Digital Ocean automated setup *
- [ ] Passive reconnaissance OSINT tool (CMS & user enumeration)
- [ ] Phishlet YAML file generator
- [ ] Small-scale email warmer ***

### Legend
- \* Uncertain if Digital Ocean API supports SSH configuration
- \*\*\* Full software application rather than script (might get straight up bored)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These scripts are intended for:
- **Authorized penetration testing**
- **Red team exercises** 
- **Security research**
- **Educational purposes**

**Use responsibly and only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.**

## 🔧 Requirements

- Linux/Unix environment (tested on Ubuntu/Kali)
- Bash shell
- Root/sudo privileges (for most scripts)
- Internet connection for downloads

## 📝 Usage

Each script directory contains its own README with specific usage instructions. General workflow:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AsherDMckoy/HAcking-Scripts.git 
cd HAcking-Scripts
cd [script-directory]
# Follow individual README instructions
```
